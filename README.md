I developed a College Management App using Flutter that provides a seamless experience for students by integrating key academic and administrative features:

Student Profiles: View personal information, academic details, and course-related updates.

Materials & Resources: Access study materials dynamically synced via Google Sheets API, ensuring real-time updates.

Fee Management: Pay tuition, hostel, and other fees securely through Razorpay, track payment history, and download receipts.

Smooth UI/UX: Integrated Lottie animations for interactive and engaging transitions and feedback.

State Management: Built with Riverpod for efficient and scalable state management across the app.

This app combines real-time data integration, secure transactions, and a smooth user experience, making academic management easy and intuitive for students.

Skills & Technologies: Flutter, Firebase, Google Sheets API, Razorpay, Riverpod, Lottie Animations, Mobile App Development
